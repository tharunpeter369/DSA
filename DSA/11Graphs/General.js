// a graph is pair of set values related in a pair vise fashion


// we can see the graph in facebook of connectin people and in google maps for connectin places(shortest path)

// linkes list are type of trees and trees are type of graph 


// type of graph   // image 3
// 1. directed graph   eg: one way road twitter am connected to celebrati and that celibraty not connected to me
// 2. undirected graph  eg: two ways road it like fb is like am connected to fried and that friend also connected to me

// another type is Wighted graph(nodes/vertex have values) //image 4
// 1.Wighted graph (both nodes/vertex and edges have values) 
// 2.unweighted graph (only nodes/vertex have values) eg: google maps for finding shortest path

// another type image 5
// 1.cyclic graph
// 2.acyclic graph



//most of the time we use tools like neo4j to implement graph
